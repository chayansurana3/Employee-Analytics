## Full Stack Developer Assignment

**Objective:**

Develop a comprehensive web application using ReactJS and NodeJS that allows users to manage company employee data. The application should offer CRUD functionality for employee records and utilize data visualization through charts, user-friendly forms for data entry and editing, and informative cards for individual employee data display.

**Backend API - Detailed Functions:**

* **Create Employee:**
    * API endpoint to accept user input for employee details (name, department, position, salary, etc.)
    * Validation for accurate and complete information
    * Store validated data in the database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
    * Return success message or error message upon completion
* **Read Employee:**
    * API endpoint to retrieve all employee data
    * Option for filtering data based on user-specified criteria (department, position, salary range, etc.)
    * Return requested employee data in JSON format
* **Update Employee:**
    * API endpoint to accept updates to existing employee information
    * Allow modification of any previously captured employee data
    * Perform data validation and update database record
    * Return success message or error message upon completion
* **Delete Employee:**
    * API endpoint to remove employee records
    * Confirmation prompt for user before permanent deletion
    * Delete employee data from the database
    * Return success message or error message upon completion

**Data Visualization:**
* Implement charts using suitable library to visualize employee data in various ways:
    * Age distribution chart (histogram)
    * Department employee count (pie chart or bar chart)
    * Salary range distribution (boxplot)
    * Additional charts based on specific data points

**User Interface:**

* **Landing Page:**
    * Overview dashboard displaying key metrics (e.g., total employees, average salary)
    * Charts visualizing employee distribution
    * Search bar for filtering employee data
* **Employee List:**
    * Table listing all employees with details like name, department, position, and salary
    * Pagination for large datasets
    * Sorting options for different data fields
* **Employee Details Card:**
    * Individual card for each employee displaying complete information
    * Visual representation of key data points (e.g., salary bar graph)
    * Buttons for editing or deleting the employee record
* **Employee Form:**
    * User-friendly interface for adding new employees or editing existing records
    * Input fields for all necessary employee details
    * Clear and concise labels for each field
    * Validation for accurate and complete information
    * Submit button to save changes

**Technical Details:**

* Programming Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript (ReactJS), NodeJS
* Frameworks/Libraries: ReactJS, Chart.js/D3.js, Bootstrap, Axios
* Database: MongoDB
* Additional Tools: Git, npm, Postman (API testing)

**Evaluation Criteria:**

* Functionality :
    * Completeness and correctness of CRUD operations for employee data
