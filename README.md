  - ```
    MONGODB_USERNAME=""
    MONGODB_PASSWORD=""
    ```
- Step 3
  - Now, from the root project directory run ```netlify dev``` command. The project would start running in your local machine.

## What I Learned

Developing the Employee Management System has been an enriching experience, providing valuable insights and enhancing my skills in full-stack web development. Here are some key takeaways from this project:

- **Full-Stack Proficiency:** Through the integration of ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend, I gained a holistic understanding of building robust, end-to-end web applications. This project has strengthened my abilities in both frontend and backend development.

- **CRUD Operations:** Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for employee records not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of data management in a real-world context.

- **Data Visualization:** Incorporating charts for visualizing employee data trends has expanded my knowledge of data visualization libraries and techniques. I learned to present complex information in a visually appealing and easily understandable format.

- **User-Friendly Design:** Crafting intuitive and user-friendly forms has refined my skills in designing interfaces that enhance user experience. I now appreciate the importance of creating interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

- **Informative Data Display:** The creation of informative employee cards challenged me to present data in a concise yet comprehensive manner. This experience enriched my skills in designing visually appealing and content-rich components.

- **Database Management:** Working with a database, specifically MongoDB in this case, has deepened my understanding of database management, including schema design, querying, and optimization.

- **Problem Solving:** Overcoming challenges such as handling large datasets, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing application performance has significantly improved my problem-solving skills.

This project has not only added practical, real-world experience to my portfolio but has also provided a solid foundation for tackling more complex and challenging web development projects in the future. I look forward to applying these skills in my continuous journey of learning and growth.
